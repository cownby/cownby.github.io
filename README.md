Jekyll projects & prototypes

I have my github.io set up to use project pages so I can prototype multiple sites. See
* [Archethought prototype using foundation](https://cownby.github.io/webPrototype-Archethought/)
* [First Archethought site I did](https://archethought.github.io/)
* [Basic, default theme I haven't done much with](https://cownby.github.io/gh-pages-prototype/)
* [Friends of Traditional Dance prototype](https://cownby.github.io/webPrototype-fotd/)
